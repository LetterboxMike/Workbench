# Design Directions

Pick one primary direction per feature or screen set. Blend only when there is a clear product reason.

## 1) Precision and Density

- Best for: admin tools, internal operations, data-heavy workflows.
- Tone: technical, efficient, focused.
- Typography: compact UI sans with high legibility at small sizes.
- Color model: restrained neutrals plus one high-contrast action accent.
- Surface model: low shadow, border-defined structure.
- Density: high; prioritize visible information without clutter.
- Motion: minimal, quick, and utility-driven.

## 2) Trust and Control

- Best for: finance, procurement, legal, compliance surfaces.
- Tone: calm, stable, deliberate.
- Typography: conservative but refined hierarchy.
- Color model: cool neutrals with limited semantic color usage.
- Surface model: layered cards with subtle contrast shifts.
- Density: medium; room for review and confirmation.
- Motion: low; emphasize predictability and state changes.

## 3) Command Center

- Best for: monitoring, incident response, logistics, support.
- Tone: high signal, urgent, operational.
- Typography: bold numerics and clear status text.
- Color model: dark or neutral base with explicit status palette.
- Surface model: segmented panels with rapid scan zones.
- Density: medium-high; optimize for glanceability.
- Motion: purposeful transitions that spotlight changed values.

## 4) Collaborative Workspace

- Best for: project tools, CRM, ticketing, product collaboration.
- Tone: approachable but professional.
- Typography: expressive headings with practical body text.
- Color model: warmer base with disciplined accent usage.
- Surface model: moderate elevation and clear grouping.
- Density: medium; balance readability with throughput.
- Motion: moderate; use for context shifts and onboarding cues.

## 5) Regulated Clarity

- Best for: healthcare admin, gov-tech, heavily audited workflows.
- Tone: explicit, careful, no ambiguity.
- Typography: conservative hierarchy with strong label clarity.
- Color model: high-contrast semantics with minimal decorative color.
- Surface model: strict separators, clear section framing.
- Density: medium-low; reduce error risk.
- Motion: minimal; avoid attention competition.

## Selection Heuristics

- Choose "Precision and Density" when users repeatedly triage large datasets.
- Choose "Trust and Control" when mistakes have high financial or legal cost.
- Choose "Command Center" when real-time status awareness drives outcomes.
- Choose "Collaborative Workspace" when teamwork and handoffs are central.
- Choose "Regulated Clarity" when auditability and explicitness beat speed.
